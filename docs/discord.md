## Group Buys

Group buys are run semi-frequently and will be announced by an event notification.

To participate in an upcoming group buy, you must first unlock the ^^Bazaar^^ in __#Channels & Roles__.

Once unlocked, you'll gain access to the __#buy-n-sell__ forum where the group buy purchase thread exists,
as well as the __#groupbuy-discussions__ channel.

If you don't see a group buy event being hosted, it either means a group buy is closed but hasn't concluded
(ie. majority shipments haven't been received) or temporary unavailable.

Please be patient as this is a volunteered process.
