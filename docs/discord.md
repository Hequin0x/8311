## Group buys

Group buys are run semi-frequently and will be announced by an event notification.

To participate in an upcoming group buy, you must first unlock the *Bazaar* in the __#Channels & Roles__ channel.

Once unlocked, you will gain access to the __#buy-n-sell__ forum, where the group buy purchase thread exists,
as well as the __#groupbuy-discussions__ channel.

If you do not see any active group buy events, it *may* mean that a group buy is currently closed but has not yet concluded
(e.g. the majority of shipments have not been received) or that it is temporarily unavailable.

Please be patient, as this is a volunteer-driven process.

## Giveaways

Giveaways are occasionally organized through the generosity of our community and its members.

To participate in a giveaway, you must first be an active member and unlock the *Bazaar* in the __#Channels & Roles__
channel.

Once unlocked, you will gain access to the __#giveaways__ channel, where you can enter *any* active giveaways
if you qualify for entry.

If you'd like to host a giveaway, please contact an admin or email: sponsor at pon.wiki to arrange the details.
